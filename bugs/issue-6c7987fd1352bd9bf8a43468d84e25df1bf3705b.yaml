title: Make stream fusion actually work
desc: |-
  I expected GHC 7.0.3 to solve the problem but it didn't. The source of
  evil is the class op specialisation preventing our fusion rules from
  firing. So I decided to wrap each and every class ops into plain
  functions to force them getting fused.
