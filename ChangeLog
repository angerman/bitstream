== bitstream-0.2 / 2011-07-08
* bugfix: Make stream fusion actually work
* Implement fromBits / toBits
* Strict Bitstreams' bit length should only be a hint, just like stream size.
* Strict Bitstream should keep bit-length maintained
* Strict bitstrems should use unstreamPackets instead of hand-written unfoldr-based unstreamers.
